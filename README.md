Implementations of adversarial attack & defense methods in ml.

## Notes

- [GAMA-FW](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14969):
    - Relatively new method (2020).
    - Cited as being a strong attacker when the number of steps is restricted. 
    - Has documented success on the CIFAR dataset.
    - Has source code for reference.
- [Towards Evaluating the Robustness...](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04644):
    - Outlines attacks tailored to three distance metrics.
    - Shows that defnse distillation does not defend against the attacks.
    - Minimum distance
